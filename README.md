### Objectives
Design and ship a modern web app demo for the InstantCard team. Research done on the InstantCard product & industry informs that users convert much better when they are given sample cards. I should go about designing and building with the intent improve on the current sample / lead generation flow + steamline/aim for readability of the landing page copy and assets. 

**Post Sprint Notes:** _I did some research on google search trends. I think the SEO results for a product "Free Employee ID designer" would drive good traffic._

### Technologies

- React 
- Redux 
- Materiul UI 
- AWS Amplify
